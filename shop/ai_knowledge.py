"""
AI-assisted drafting of a product's "Product Knowledge" (problem solved, who
it's for, differentiator, search keywords) and buyer Q&A: the plain-language
layer AI systems like ChatGPT and Claude need to understand, recommend and
cite a product, kept separate from persuasive sales copy.

This module only drafts. Nothing here touches the database; the admin view
that calls it shows the draft for the owner to edit and only saves what they
approve.
